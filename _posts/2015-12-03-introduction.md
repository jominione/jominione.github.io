My interests lie in political economy, business, tech, and strategy and I plan to write about these topics here. My education background has been in economics and the framework of how I look at problems has been largely influenced by that methodology. 

Having been thinking about these topics for a long time I feel I’m starting to have a better picture of the relationship and structure between the domains and hopefully through the process of writing I can produce a more robust set of thoughts.

Blogs are spur of the moment, messy, and cheap to produce in effort and time and I’m going to keep to that ethos.

What I don’t like about blogs is the lack of structure that books provide so my plan is to use the blog as a process to produce drafts of what hopefully will be a cookbook on 'business from first principles'. By first principles I mean grounded in logically coherent theory from the bottom up.
