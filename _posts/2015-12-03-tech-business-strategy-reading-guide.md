I’ve been following the tech scene for a couple of years and over that time I’ve filtered through and compiled a reference list of blogs/podcasts as primer to the tech sector. This list is by no means comprehensive and strongly oriented towards the business/strategy side of tech.



##Essential Reading

**[Stratechery](https://stratechery.com){:target="_blank"}** by Ben Thompson is a must read. If I could only read one blog/daily update this would be it. Can’t praise highly enough. I started following his blog in 2013 before it evolved into a paid daily update and I would’ve probably been one of the earliest paid subscribers.

Sole focus on tech companies, providing analysis on strategy. Insane level of insight per number of words.

He writes one article per week on his blog but if you subscribe for an annual membership USD100 (I would happily pay 10x) you get access to daily update with deep analysis on the tech news of the day.

He also runs a weekly podcast **[Exponent](http://exponent.fm){:target="_blank"}** with James Allworth which is essentially a podcast version of the daily updates but with Ben and James often debating/playing devil's advocate.



##Staple Reading

**[Steve Cheney](http://stevecheney.com){:target="_blank"}**
NY based cofounder of beacons technology startup [Estimote](http://estimote.com){:target="_blank"} Steve Cheney blogs about the strategic implications of hardware technology. Blogs infrequently but when Steve does they’re epic. The advantage of blogging infrequently means you can read through his historical posts in quick time.

Don’t quote me, but think Steve has an electrical engineering background. If the case it shows. Best source of analysis that bridge the tech hardware and business strategy divide.


**[Benedict Evans](http://ben-evans.com/#blog){:target="_blank"}** is an analyst at the VC firm [Andreessen Horowitz](http://a16z.com){:target="_blank"}. Tech and strategy focus. I find Ben’s style hard to describe. Always insightful and analysis is uniquely 'abstract'(?) at times.

**[Asymco](http://www.asymco.com){:target="_blank"}** 
Horace Dediu blogs about tech and strategy with strong emphasis on Apple through a [disruption theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation){:target="_blank"} lens in the [Christensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen){:target="_blank"} sense. Was the first analyst blogger I started following. Also runs the **[Critical Path](http://5by5.tv/criticalpath){:target="_blank"}** podcast.

**[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net){:target="_blank"}** by John Gruber is to the Apple blogosphere what [Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com){:target="_blank"} is to the econ blogosphere. Most influential blogger in the Applephere. I encountered most of the bloggers here first on Daring Fireball. One reason to regularly read Daring Fireball is to get an understanding of how Apple thinks. I’m not referring to financial analysis or strategy but the values that Apple hold dear. John has a great understanding in the way Apple thinks about design, user experience, and product. The key to understanding Apple is that the business model and strategy follows from the former and not vice versa. Also runs **[The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/){:target="_blank"}** podcast.

**[Both Sides of the Table](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com){:target="_blank"}** by LA based VC Mark Suster provides refreshingly honest and always practical advice about tech startups. This is the only VC blogger I follow religiously. Oriented towards practicality and human side of running a startup than strategy. Runs **[Both Sides of the Table TV podcast/youtube channel](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BothsidesTV){:target="_blank"}**.

**[The Morning Paper](http://blog.acolyer.org){:target="_blank"}** by Adrian Colyer is a VC. Here he summarises important articles in the field of computer science. I don’t pretend to understand any of it but I think one of the best ways to learn a new domain is to dig right in. This blog provides an efficient way of doing so. In particular I highly recommend [this post](http://blog.acolyer.org/2015/04/29/applying-the-universal-scalability-law-to-organisations/){:target="_blank"} on organisation theory.

**[Bare Figures](https://barefigur.es){:target="_blank"}** is not a blog. But great resource for data visualisation and quick reference for financial data of major tech companies.

**[a16z podcast](http://a16z.com/tag/podcasts/){:target="_blank"}** is great for general understanding of the going ons in the tech startup world.


##Niche

**[Around the Coin](http://www.aroundthecoin.com){:target="_blank"}** is the podcast on the payments industry through the lens of tech. Great insight into the future of payments sector and bitcoin. I would put this as staple reading except for the fact that its narrowed to the payment sector (which is quite broad in itself!). Don’t underestimate the payments sector as there are a lot of innovation going on there headlined by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Square](https://squareup.com/){:target="_blank"}. Bitcoin and blockchain technology is making this a very dynamic sector.

If I could only listen to one podcast this would be it. The speakers have a mixture of tech, payments, consulting, and startup backgrounds. Speakers understand the technical side of things but give perspective from business and user experience point of view. VCs, startup operators, and investment bankers go to these guys for insight into their domain. Special shout out to [Brian Roemmele](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brian-Roemmele){:target="_blank"} seriously know his shit. Has a insane record in predicting technology roadmaps and outcome of initiatives of tech players.

**[Asymcar](http://www.asymcar.com){:target="_blank"}** is a podcast on car industry through the lens of disruption theory. Run by Horace who I listed above. Horace was prescient about the tech sector moving into the car sector blogging and podcasting of the potential for disruption before the recent revelations that major tech companies are investing in automated cars and like technologies.

**[Above Avalon](http://www.aboveavalon.com){:target="_blank"}** by Neil Cybart is run similarly to Stratechery but with a more specific on Apple. Also has a [podcast](http://www.aboveavalon.com/podcast/){:target="_blank"}. 

**[Platform Thinking](http://platformed.info){:target="_blank"}** blog by Sangeet Choudary is a operator's handbook on platforms.
